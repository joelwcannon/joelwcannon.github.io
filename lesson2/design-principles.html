               Fitt’s Law states that buttons that are larger and closer are more likely to be clicked.  Note how Intuit places a Large, clearly labeled, colorful button immediately below the last item on the registration form.  Each textbox is ordered sequentially, so it is clear what to do next.  The alternate Sign in button is much smaller and above the form.  All of the buttons are blue, so they are easy to identify.  But size and location is used according to Fitt’s Law to encourage new registrations.

               Audible has a large list of audio books, so presenting lots of information is a challenge.  Here you see how they organize books in rows with a cover, title and referral all grouped close together.  The next row is separated by a subtitle, making it clear that those are different books.  The white space also gathers all the related information together.

               Mint repeats colors, fonts and buttons to focus your attention and help you get started.  The orange Sign up Free button is repeated at the top of the page. The sign-up/in buttons are repeated with different colors.  The teal color from the logo is repeated to focus your attention.  And the two fonts are repeated consistently.

               WolframAlpha uses colors, titles, boxes and columns to create a hierarchy of information.  All of the orange Mathematics topics are clearly grouped. The menu options at the top are placed in their own hierarchy.

            Google Translate uses contrasting backgrounds to separate the translated inputs and outputs. The text is
            presented in colors that contrast the backgrounds, making them easy to read. Contrasting fonts are used to
            focus your attention. High and low contrast icons help you understand which are active.
